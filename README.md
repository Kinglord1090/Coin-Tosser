# Coin Flip Simulator ðŸª™

This project is a coin flip simulator that allows users to flip a virtual coin a specified number of times. It generates a sequence of "Heads" (H) and "Tails" (T) based on random outcomes and counts the number of each. The tool is useful for demonstrating probability and randomness in a simple and interactive way.

## Features

- **Random Coin Flips**: Utilizes Python's `random` module to generate random outcomes of "Heads" or "Tails".
- **Customizable Number of Flips**: Users can specify how many times they want to flip the coin.
- **Detailed Results**:
  - **Sequence Display**: Shows a sequence of results using "H" for heads and "T" for tails.
  - **Count Summary**: Displays the total count of heads and tails.
- **Simple and Interactive**: Takes user input to determine the number of flips.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/coin-flip-simulator.git
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd coin-flip-simulator
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python coin-flip-sim.py
    ```
3. Follow the prompt:
   - Enter the number of times you want to flip the coin.
4. The program will display:
   - A sequence of "H" (Heads) and "T" (Tails).
   - A summary count of heads and tails.
